- Can use any file, but pygame loads bitmaps(.bmp) by default

# Notes about python on windows
- pip install pygame
- A helper method does work inside a class but isn't meant to be called through an instance
- $ pip install --user pipenv
- python -m pip install

# Playing on different systems 
- On Windows the game settings seem to be moderate to semi-fast
- On MacOS the settings seem extremely slow, so there needs to be a way to adjust settings based off the operating system
